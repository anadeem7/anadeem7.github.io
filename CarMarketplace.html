        <h1 class="animated rotateInDownLeft"><em><strong>Welcome to Car Marketplace</strong></em></h1>
		  <p>Here at RevLimit, we are all for helping out people in the car community. So, what better way to help out then to give some top tips/tricks on buying/selling and trading in your car for the right price. Below are going to be a list of things you should focus on when trying to get the best bang for your buck. These are just some basic tips that will help you gain some type of background knowledge before you step into the real world marketplace and see what good deals you can score.</p>
		<h2><strong>Buying</strong></h2>
		<ol>
		  <li><strong>Do your research beforehand</strong></li>
			<p>Don’t let the excitement of buying a new car distract you. Do a bit of research beforehand, keep your budget into consideration. Search on the online car inventory of dealerships near you, or if you want to buy a car from a private party then search on car marketplaces like Facebook, OfferUp, Craigslist etc. Compare prices, monthly owning cost, reliability and availability so you can get the best deal. </p>
		  <li><strong>Narrow your choices</strong></li>
			<p>Make a list of must haves you want in a car, keeping your budget in mind. Things like features, color, size, fuel economy, towing capacity (if buying a truck for hauling things like trailers), maintenance cost etc. Go to Kelly blue book to find out the value of a car you are looking for, so you have a starting point and an estimate on how much the car is worth. This way you have some background knowledge and are not just trying to buy whatever seems like a good deal. Ultimately the decision will come down to your personal preference. </p>
		  <li><strong>Always test drive</strong></li>
			<p>Once you have decided upon a car of your choice. Don’t rush your decision, make sure to test drive the car before you commit on buying it, because you may not like the way it drives, or you may not like the features it offers. If you are buying a used car from a private party and you know a thing or two about cars, look for any weird noises while test driving or accident history, ask for a Carfax report, car maintenance history etc. If you want a piece of mind and don’t know much about car’s, take the used car into inspection at an automotive shop before buying it. They can look over the car for you and let you know if there is anything wrong. </p>
		  <li><strong>Work on negotiating the price</strong></li>
			<p>You finally decided on the car you want, you test drove the car and you loved it, now comes the fun part. If you are buying a new car, work with the salesman on the price, ask about any additional discounts you may be eligible for, any fees that can be waived, if you can lower your monthly cost and the interest rate. If you are buying a car from a private party, point out any defects/broken parts/body damage/noises etc. This way you can bring the price down a little and score a good deal. </p>
		  <li><strong>Don't be afraid to walk away</strong></li>
			<p>If you think you are not getting a fair deal, don’t be afraid to say no and walk away. There are plenty of cars and great deals out there to chose from. Don’t feel rushed or pressured to buy a car just because you took time to go look and test drive it. Sometimes the worst decisions are made in a rush.</p>
		  </ol>
		<h2><strong>Selling</strong></h2>
		  <ol>
		  <li><strong>Fix mechanical issues</strong></li>
			<p>Fix any minor mechanical issues that you might have, it will help increase the value of your car and its less of a headache to sell a car that has no problems. This also ensures that the buyer can’t point anything bad (broken, in need of repair) about your car to bring the value down.</p>
		  <li><strong>Detail the Car</strong></li>
			<p>Sometimes people don’t pay attention to this step and it’s the most important detail. Always clean your car before selling it, not only does it show the buyer that you care about the car, but it also gives a very good first impression. Plus, who doesn’t like to buy a clean car that looks and smells good. </p>  
		  <li><strong>Find the accurate value of your car</strong></li>
			<p>Go to a website like Kelly blue book and enter the accurate information so you can find the actual value of your car. Their it tells you the price if you are trading in, or selling to a private party, the price adjusts accordingly. </p>  
		  <li><strong>Post your advertisement online</strong></li>
			<p>Take some good pictures of your car after cleaning it, find out the value of your car, fill out all the necessary information for the listing, write a description on it, make sure to mention all the repairs you have done to the car, having a clean Carfax report is a bonus, keep you price at least $200-$500 above what the Kelly blue book value is for your car, so this way you have some room for negotiations. If you know your car is worth the list price you have listed it at, don’t back down from that price. Don’t be afraid to decline low ball offers just because buyers like to offer you less money then what the asking price is. Post it on multiple car marketplaces like Facebook marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp etc. so you have a wide range of audience.</p>  
		  <li><strong>Only accept cash</strong></li>
			<p>Once you have a buyer ready to buy the car, make it clear that you will only accept cash, no checks or money orders, this will make sure that you don’t get scammed. Make sure to fill out all information correctly on your cars title when transferring it to the new owner. </p>  
		  </ol>
		<h2><strong>Trade-ins</strong></h2>
		  <ol>
		  <li><strong>Do your research before hand</strong></li>
			<p>Before you go and trade in your car make sure to do a bit of research as to who is offering a good deal for trade-ins. Sometimes car dealerships near you will give you a great offer depending on the car you own. So, look online or call dealerships near you and see what deals are being offered.</p>  
		  <li><strong>Know the value of your car</strong></li>
			<p>Go to Kelly blue book and enter in the correct information of your car to get an estimate on what your car is worth, make sure to select the trade-in option so value is adjusted accordingly. Knowing the value of your car is a very important first step as it gives you some background knowledge.</p> 
		  <li><strong>Have all the legal documents ready</strong></li>
			<p>Have all your legal documents like title, personal property tax, driver’s license etc, ready when you are ready to go get your car appraised.</p>  
		  <li><strong>Work on negotiating the deal</strong></li>
			<p>Before you accept a deal that has been offered to you, try to negotiate the price by asking for discounts, fee waivers, monthly specials etc. Some dealerships give great discount on new cars if you happen to trade in your old car with them, so keep an eye out for that before settling on an offer.</p> 
		  <li><strong>Shop around</strong></li>
			<p>Don’t be afraid to reject or say no to an offer and walk away if you feel that you are not getting a good deal. There are plenty of dealerships that might give you a better deal then the previous one. Don’t feel as if you have to accept that offer. </p>  
		  </ol>
